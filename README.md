## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
- Meetup: Event planning app
  - The option to click maps and get redirected to Apple maps
- BeReal: Social Media App
  - The feature where the calendar is filled with small pics of the posts you've made on each day.
- Pinterest: Picture media app
  - The FYP has pictures that are different sizes and clean-fitting. It gives the page a refreshing look and makes it look interactive.

**My App Idea**
I want to make a trip and travel planning application that helps people asynchronously set timers check locations and set checkpoints for their trips and plans.
I want the app to be able to send notifications and also help the user track the locations of their fellow travelers.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Just getting used to coding in Swift and working with the elements using UIkit. I also wanted to add some things myself so had to 
go and use outside resources to make it a bit more personalized.
